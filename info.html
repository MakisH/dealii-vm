<h1>Welcome to the deal.II virtual box image!</h1>

<p> <b>NOTE:</b> Before you get started, make sure you set up your
virtual machine settings to the appropriate <u>number of
cores</u> (<= the number of cores in your system) and
<u>amount of RAM</u> (at most your total RAM minus 1GB). Be aware
that a <u>powerful machine</u> is recommended for this virtual
image to work. For serious computations we recommend running
deal.II natively on a linux machine.
